# ICON P-Rep Community Meeting #2

Date: 2020-02-22 11:00 PM UTC

Attendees: Blockmove, Catalyst, Espanicon, ICONation, ICONBet, Icon4Business, RHIZOME, UBIK Capital

## Meeting Main Topics

- One of the difficult topics I can think of that we could discuss is - what competitive advantage ICON blockchain has over other blockchains and how could we stimulate dapp growth.
- Broof adoption has been taking off in SK lately. What can we do as P-Reps to bolster adoption in local markets? Should we create a pitch deck that all P-Reps we can use to pitch certificate issuance on ICON network?
