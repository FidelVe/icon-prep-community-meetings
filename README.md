# ICON P-Rep Community Meetings

The purpose of ICON P-Rep Community Meetings is to foster discussion and action between ICON P-Reps. These meetings are separate from ICON Foundation's monthly meeting, and will focus on smaller topics within the community.

## How to Submit a Meeting Topic

To submit a meeting topic, please add it to the relevant thread on the [ICON Community Forum](https://forum.icon.community). The link to the thread for each week's meeting will be shared in the ICON P-Rep Community Meetings Telegram channel.

Following discussion, the final list of five topics will be finalized and published two days before the meeting.

## How to Participate

Meetings are open to all ICON P-Reps, and will be conducted via Zoom. The meetings will be livestreamed on YouTube for ICONists to watch.

Prior to each meeting, the link and password will be published to the ICON P-Rep Community Meetings Telegram channel. If you do not have access to this channel, please reach out to Catalyst (@catalystnode) or [RHIZOME](https://t.me/rhizomeicx).

To ensure we stay on track, please join the meeting 10-15 minutes ahead of time to test your audio and video (optional). Lastly, only one member from each P-Rep team is allowed to attend the meeting.
